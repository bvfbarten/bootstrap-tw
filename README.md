This repo is a combination of bootstrap 5 with tailwind

This is beneficial to me in that the libraries compliment each other incredibly well. Boostrap is good as a component based library while tailwind exists as a functional css library.  Combining the two allows to download bootstrap templates, and then modify them with tailwind. This also allows to treeshake the bootstrap css so make the final css file size much smaller.

**Requirements**

tailwindcss as per [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)

* npm install -D tailwindcss
* npx tailwindcss init

modify the tailwind.config.css file content to the location of your html files
